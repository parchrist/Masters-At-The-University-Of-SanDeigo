This Repo is all of my course work for my Masters of Applied Artificial Intelligence at the Univeristy of SanDiego 

Each File upload will contain the following
1. Assignments- Weekly homework assigned
2. Discussion posts- Just my response to the discussion board of the week, does not include the question being asked. It is just my response
3. Group Project- These are the Final Projects in the course. We do not have finals but, the group project is supposed to replicate some of the projects we would deal with in the real world.
