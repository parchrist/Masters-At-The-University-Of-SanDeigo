This Repo is all of my course work for my Masters of Applied Artificial Intelligence at the Univeristy of SanDiego 

## Every File Will contain the following for every single class 
Each File upload will contain the following
1. `Assignments`- Weekly homework assigned
2. `Discussion posts` - Just my response to the discussion board of the week, does not include the question being asked. It is just my response
3. `Group Project` - These are the Final Projects in the course. We do not have finals but, the group project is supposed to replicate some of the projects we would deal with in the real world.

## Group Projects Descriptions 

#### MSAAI 500- `US Automobile Accident Severity Prediction`
- Analyzed over 2 million car accidents, attempting to predict the severity of car accidents with multiple variables using a Classification Model from SkLearn
- Full EDA of data set, Statistical Analysis of the severity levels, Model evaluation, and Model Optimization.
- Data set not included due to the CSV file being 3GB.
- Link to the data set https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents
  
#### MSAAI 501 - `From Pixels to Sharpies: Evaluating MNIST Models Against Real Handwritten Digits`
- Analyzed the MNIST data set 70,000 images from the NIST Machine Learning Repo
- EDA of the Data Using a Uniform Manifold Project plots to see the way the data was shaped, and to get a feel for the way that the models would have a hard time processing and predicting
- Used a total of 4 model architectures, SVM, K-neighbors, CNN and MLP Neural Networks
- Full optimized every single Neural Network model, by expanding the width of the layer, or by adding additional layers. 
- Tested our own handwritten digits two ways, hand-drawn and a HTML draw box
- Full critique on the MNIST data set, explaining that the data set is just a training and first project data set, and could not be used for any real-world application without extensive image pre-processing.

#### MSAAI 530 - `Data analytics and the Internet of Things`
- Analyzed the data set from a real IOT device that was collecting data from a real-world device
- The goal of the project was to predict the temperature of the device based on the other variables in the data set, and see if someone was present in the rooom. 
- Though our EDA we were able to see that the data was from an office building, and we were also able to detect when someone would be in the room based off the time. 
- We created a Tableau dashboard to show the data in a more visual way, and to show the data in a way that was more understandable to the average person, and show it to stakeholders. 

#### MSAAI 531 - `AI Ethics & Society`
- This class was a 6 week long group project that had deliverables every week, that all had to be submitted by the final group. 
- The project was based off of templates that the instructure had developed, that we had to fill out in order to build the final project. 
- The final was all of the documents that we had created, and a final presentation that we had to film, and upload for the class to be able to view. 

#### MSAAI 510 - `Machine Learning: Fundamentals and Applications`
- We analyzed No show appointments in Brazil, and attempted to predict if a patient would show up to their appointment based on the data that was given. 
- Doing this we utilized multiple models, but the best model we had was the support vetcor machine. This model was able to predict with a 79% accuracy if a patient would show up to their appointment.
- This model worked for our needs because it is able to handle null data very well, and once we start adding features to the model, we will more than likely have null values, especially in the medical field, were not all data is collected due to hippa laws. 
- We also layed out a full potential data pipeline that we can test on, send precitions to back end tables, and then have the front end display the data in a way that is understandable to the user in PowerBI.

#### MSAAI 511 - `Neural Networks and Deep Learning`
- We analyzed the MIDI data set, that was made up of four composers, Chopin, Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart each has 250 songs to 1250 songs for each composer. 
- We used multiple models to attempt to predict the model, and we ended up with a high accuracy of 86% with the model. 
- We wanted to be able to use the piano roll to predict the composer, but we were not able to get the model to work with the piano roll due to the memory usage on our machines, maxing out at 64gb of ram.
