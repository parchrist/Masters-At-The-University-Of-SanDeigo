This Repo is all of my course work for my Masters of Applied Artificial Intelligence at the Univeristy of SanDiego 

## Every File Will contain the following for every single class 
Each File upload will contain the following
1. `Assignments`- Weekly homework assigned
2. `Discussion posts` - Just my response to the discussion board of the week, does not include the question being asked. It is just my response
3. `Group Project` - These are the Final Projects in the course. We do not have finals but, the group project is supposed to replicate some of the projects we would deal with in the real world.

## Group Projects Descriptions 

#### MSAAI 500- `US Automobile Accident Severity Prediction`
- Analyzed over 2 million car accidents, attempting to predict the severity of car accidents with multiple variables using a Classification Model from SkLearn
- Full EDA of data set, Statistical Analysis of the severity levels, Model evaluation, and Model Optimization.
- Data set not included due to the CSV file being 3GB.
- Link to the data set https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents
  
#### MSAAI 501 - `From Pixels to Sharpies: Evaluating MNIST Models Against Real Handwritten Digits`
- Analyzed the MNIST data set 70,000 images from the NIST Machine Learning Repo
- EDA of the Data Using a Uniform Manifold Project plots to see the way the data was shaped, and to get a feel for the way that the models would have a hard time processing and predicting
- Used a total of 4 model architectures, KVM, K-neighbors, CNN and MLP Neural Networks
- Full optimized every single Neural Network model, by expanding the width of the layer, or by adding additional layers. 
- Tested our own handwritten digits two ways, hand-drawn and a HTML draw box
- Full critique on the MNIST data set, explaining that the data set is just a training and first project data set, and could not be used for any real-world application without extensive image pre-processing.
