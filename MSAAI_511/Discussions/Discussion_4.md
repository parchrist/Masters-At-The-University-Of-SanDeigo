Facial Recognition and CNNs

Pick one of these applications and discuss the questions below:

1. What is the problem that CNNs are solving in this application?
When thinking about CNN's and facial recognition, the problem that CNN's are solving is the ability to recognize and identify faces in images. This is a complex problem because one persons face can have lots of variaton, from light, makeup etc. CNN's colud potentially solve this problem by learning the features of faces and using this information to identify faces in video, or images. 

2. How do CNNs work to solve this problem?
CNN's solve this problem by using convolutional layers to learn the features of peoples faces. Then the network uses these features to identify faces in images or video. But with that being said, CNN's are not perfect and can make mistakes when identifying faces.

3. What are the advantages of using CNNs over other techniques?
The advantages of CNN's when doing facial recoginition is the accuracy. A CNN can learn the features of a face and use this information to identify faces in images or video. This is a huge advantage because it can be used in many different applications, and realsed via an API, which makes launching and deploying the model, a lot easier. 

4. What are the limitations of CNNs in this application?
The limitations of CNN's in facial recognition is the accuracy. CNN's can make mistakes when identifying faces, and this can be a huge problem when using this technology in real world applications. When the model is trained on hundreds of thousands of images, it can still make mistakes when identifying faces, especially when the faces are not clear or have makeup on them, or if the testing data is different from the training data, and new people are introduced to the model. But when the the model is trying to detect millions of people in the sense of Chinas tracking system, the amount of data that the model has to be trained on is huge, and the model has to be constantly updated to keep up with the new faces that are being introduced to the model (Davies, 2021). Ulitmately  you will have to think about the cost of the model, and the amount of upkeep that the model will need, to be accurate.

5. What improvements can be made to CNNs to make them more effective in this application?
CNN's can be improved by using more data, and the model should be constantly updated. This will help the model learn the features of the peoples faces better, but the model at some point has to be trained on peoples faces to be able to reconize them later. Considering that, if you model is only detecting a couple faces, then the model should be trained on a couple of faces, and have tons of data backing up those faces at lots of angles.
