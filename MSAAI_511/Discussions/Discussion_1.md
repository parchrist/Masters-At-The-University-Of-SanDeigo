There are not to many applications where deep learning can be fully applied in the healthcare world because the majority of the data I work with is structured, and the data also has missing values a lot of the time. However there has been a small portion of the healthcare world that has started to use deep learning, specifically LLM's. The staffs notes, and memos for each client do take a very long time to do when you are dealing with specific cases and there are some companies that integrate directly over EHR's and they use the context embedded in the HTML to pull out things from documents and progress notes to help aid the staff to help with their notes. The application I am referencing is called arcadia.io. After reading their summarization they included that Admin tasks could be reduced by 33%, and that their implementation of their model could potentially predict adverse side effects of the client (Green, 2024). With that being said, I am not 100% sure on how the model was trained, as there are lots of things that models cant take into consideration but, it does seem like a very promising start to making the task of documentation better.
