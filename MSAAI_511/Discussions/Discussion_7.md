When thinkning about the different kinds of linear regression models, I think that the best one that is able to solve the most real world problems is the multiple linear regression model. This is because it is able to take into account multiple variables and how they interact with each other. I think it particular it is the most widely applicable to real world senarios, because there are many problem types that it can solve. For example, if you are trying to predict the price of a house, you would need to take into account the size of the house, number of rooms, location, and many other factors that have some correlation to the cost of the home. A multiple linear regression model would be able to take all of these factors into account and give you a more accurate prediction.

I think that linear regression models can also solve classification problems as well. I think that the large majority of buisness problems do not require a deep neural network to solve the issue at hand, and that a simple linear regression model would be able to solve the problem. I think that the multiple linear regression model would be able to solve the most real world problems because it is able to take into account multiple variables and how they interact with each other. Considering that, it is able to solve a wider range of problems than the other linear regression models, or logistic regression models. Regression models in my eyes are really good at binary classification problems, and I think that the multiple linear regression model is the best at solving these problems.
