I have been using Chat-GPT, for a while to help with some tasks, and using it to introduce myself to complex topics. Chat GPT is a LLM that is able to generate what the user wants to hear based off of the text input that I give it. But they did combine the two models GPT-3.5 with one of their other products which was DALLE. So every once and a while I will have it generate some art for a landing page to a SharePoint site at my work. 

I think that generative art/images could be valuable to people who want to implement AI generated scenes into movies, where a set would be to expensive to make or don't really have a big budget, but I think that in the long term, there might be some kind of plateau that happens with the models and the images or video being produced cant be made all that much better because the models need so much more computational power. I think that our abilities will be capped by the GPU and CPU when it comes to these generative models. I think that we are able to feed models tons of data, but to be able to evaluate the models and test them quicker than they are being made to see if they are actually able to produce high quality images and videos. I think that this technology could end up replacing some jobs in the film industry, but there will always be a need to have animation teams, but maybe not that many people on one team. I also think freelancers will also be effected as well, as people can just go to a website and make an image or a short 30 film with their prompts, and the model will do the rest.
