I have honestly been using GitHub's co-pilot extension for VS code and then just chat GPT as well. When I am working or when I am trying to learn something new that is way outside of my wheel house I will almost instinctively at this point turn to Chat GPT just for a very rough topic introduction and examples. For example I used regular Chat GPT learning between different syntax's in HIVE SQL and T-SQL. When using these NLP products, more specifically Chat GPT,  I do notice that every once and a while it will give an incorrect output as expected. A good example of this was, when I was working with four data frames at my job just doing some very basic categorical grouping, GitHub Co-pilot was pulling a totally different data frame than the one I was actually working with. I use Co-Pilot for when I am working on doing some basic plotting or boiler plate code, which it is really good at doing. But when doing some of the more complex tasks, I do notice that it has a hard time keeping up. I think that what Git Hub and Open AI has done is great but, I do not enjoy the full integration of it into Microsoft's product ecosystem. I find the co-pilot responses and in general some of the things Microsoft's version of Co-Pilot to be quite annoying. When I am browsing on Edge, or trying to make DAX measures in power bi, the responses and some of the calculations that it produces are just off putting and not the greatest. I think that these NLP code interpreters are great at doing basic things like plotting, bucket sorting, and very very basic loop functions but, to try and integrate these things with every day tasks in the work place, I think that it is just very hard to do and predict responses for.
